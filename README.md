# nws-area-forecast-discussion

I like to read the National Weather Service's Area Forecast Discussion on my phone. But the AFD page on my local office's website isn't responsive. This project gets the local AFD and presents it in a simple responsive page.

If you're interested in using this, you can change the location on line 2 of script.js to that of your local office.

(But really, this is just a personal tinkering project.)
